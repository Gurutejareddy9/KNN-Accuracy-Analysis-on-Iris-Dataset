# KNN Accuracy Analysis on Iris Dataset
 This script demonstrates the use of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify the Iris dataset.It evaluates the effect of different numbers of neighbors (k) on the modelâ€™s performance. Key features include:
1.	Dataset: The Iris dataset, a classic example for classification tasks.
2.	Model Evaluation: Splits the data into training and testing sets to evaluate KNN performance.
3.	Accuracy Analysis: Compares training and testing accuracy for varying k values (1 to 8).
4.	Visualization: Plots a graph of accuracy vs. number of neighbors to analyze overfitting and underfitting trends.

This code provides insights into choosing the optimal number of neighbors for KNN to balance model accuracy.
